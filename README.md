# hhangman
Hangman in Haskell, a quick learning project while reading http://learnyouahaskell.com
To play the Haskell version you'll need to download and compile it with ghc.

Also hangman in Elm, which is here: http://benjaminrosenbaum.github.io/hhangman/

And the messy beginnings of a haskell poetry generator.
